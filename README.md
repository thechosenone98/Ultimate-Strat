# Ultimate Strat
This is a mod for a Fender Stratocaster guitar. It consist of 6x8 analog switch IC and allows to combine the 6 coils present inside 3 humbucker coils in any configuration you can image. To control it, you simply use a rotary encoder and the display tells you the current configuration you are in.

## Features
* Thousands of different combinations possible
* EInk Display makes the 9V battery last for a very long time (1 year on the battery I used)
* * Use your 5 way switch to change between 5 saved coil configurations
* You can save a profile (all 5 current configuration at once) by long pressing the rotary encoder for 4 seconds
* Shutdown by long pressing until screen flickers to a striped pattern


## Usage
* Long press the rotary encoder for 3 seconds to enter the menu
* Click rotary encoder to select the coil you want to change
* Turn the rotary encoder to select the coil configuration
* Long press for 3 seconds to exit the menu
